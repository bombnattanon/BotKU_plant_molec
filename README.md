# BotKU_plant_molec

This repo is used for the Plant Molecular Biology module at Kasetsart University.

Here, you will learn basic Linux commands and basic script to assembly a plant plastome.

The dependencies are available on the KU Nontri AI server (V100) only and should not work if you run these scripts outside the cluster.
